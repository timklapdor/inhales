This is a first attempt at a couple of things:

1. first is using gihub pages,
2. using jekyll,
3. customising a jekyll theme,
4. actively curating and commenting links, not just hoarding them
4. and biggest of all - attempting to record what I'm reading, listening and watching.

I am planning an accompanying blog - *Exhale* - which will be outputs from me. 

This is definately a work in progress, and something that will evolve over time. 

Stay tuned. 

Cheers,

Tim Klapdor
