        <title>Yoda Is Dead but Star Wars’ Dubious Lessons Live On</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This interview with science fiction writer David Brin about Star Wars is incredibly enlightening. I have not given much thought to the plot (and plot holes) of Star Wars in general. Partly because I don&amp;#39;t care to intellectualise the movies beyond what they are and partly because of how bad the prequel movies were it was worth not reliving. What I particularly enjoyed in this article was the deconstruction of Yoda, not as some kind of zen master but as evil overlord. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoda, in Attack of the Clones, orders the Jedi into a suicide charge that kills most of them, then conveniently shows up with the new clone army that he ordered. An act of treachery and betrayal so stunning that I had to watch the movie twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always had an issue with the jump Anakin made from being slightly disconcerted with the Jedi hierachy to killing a room full of kids but Yoda&amp;#39;s got nothing on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on Yoda&amp;#39;s contiuning screw ups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mace Windu, on the other hand, is the only intelligent Jedi depicted in any film. He found evidence of Senator Palpatine’s plot. Mace wanted to tell the Republic—Yoda overruled him. When all the other Jedi are falling into a stupid trap ordered by Yoda, Mace is the one who does his job as a secret agent, sneaks up to the balcony, and puts a light saber to the bad guy’s throat. If one Jedi more had accompanied him, it would’ve been over. Mace, in confronting Palpatine, was the only one who tries to do what the Jedi are supposed to do, but he fails because Yoda screwed up the training of the dangerous apprentice, Anakin, and orders the Jedi to do a frontal assault into an arena filled with a hundred thousand laser wielding enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Learning is Not a Mechanism: Assessment, Student Agency, and Digital Spaces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in Digital Pedagogy and the discussion around it you need not look further than the work of Jessie Stommel. He&amp;#39;s perhaps my favourite writer and provocateur on the subject. Always clear concise and thought provoking Jesse has an amazing way of bringing together the practices of teaching, the systems of education and the ways we merge these with technology and learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slidedeck seems to be more of a visually supported essay (one who&amp;#39;s format I&amp;#39;m going to take note of) and delves into the word of Assessment. Assessment is very much at the heart of todays education system whether we like it or not and it impacts K-12 all the way through to Higher Ed. The system we&amp;#39;ve created to &amp;quot;measure learning&amp;quot; (because I am sceptical that it actually does this) is predicated on placing a numerical value on learning - an abstraction of a proxy of a complex, multi-temporal, biological function. I find it incredible that we seek to simplify this function rather than embrace it&amp;#39;s beauty and complexity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse&amp;#39;s article is incredibly insightful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve built an impenetrable phalanx of clarity, certainty, and defensibility. There is no space for student agency in a system of incessant grading, ranking, and scoring. The grade takes the complexity of human interaction within a learning environment and makes it machine-readable: [A/A-] [A-/B+] [F+] [97%] [59%] [18/20] [10/20]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m not opposed to a grading system - in the sense of a standardised system that facilitates transactions and transparency - what we have now is very much a bastardised version of that. Where the aim of learning is the grade, rather than it acting as a compass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we work to design a new approach to assessment within digital systems that focuses on formative rather than summative assessment, intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation, relationships rather than ranking, emergence rather than predetermined outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse goes on to argue the case for greater student agency, for students to be part of the actual process of &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; rather than the recipients of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We’re all data now</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This podcast is a discussion on Big Data from a legal perspective. There&amp;#39;s some really interesting points here - in particular about the legal lens we operate under. The US focusses on National Security, the EU through Privacy but it would be interesting to see it persued as Property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I really got out of this was an interesting way of understanding why Big Data has become such a popular and messianic figure in our culture. As Annelise Riles states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I noticed was that after the 2008 crisis, regulators started to lose confidence in their own understanding of how the market worked. And at the same time, because they had been trained in that neoliberal era they also didn&amp;#39;t have confidence in government planning because the whole neoliberal idea was governments don&amp;#39;t know how to plan. So imagine what it&amp;#39;s like to be a regulator in that situation. You simply have no idea how to control this market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d relate this observation back to complexity. Complex systems don&amp;#39;t allow you to control anything in the same way that a hierarchical, simple or even complicated system would. Big data is becoming the way in which people are being fooled into thinking that control has been regained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that that idea that big data can save us from the failures of our expertise is not unique to finance. And in fact just for ordinary people, perhaps when we lose our confidence in how to choose a university or which flavour of ice cream to buy or how to choose a sexual partner, we suddenly turn to big data as a way of getting us out of our loss of expertise. So I see this turn to big data as a symptom of our sense that perhaps we&amp;#39;ve lost our foundations in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades (not just since 2008) expertise and insight have been slowly eroded by economic ideals. That everything can be simplified into a cell in a spreadsheet and a number attached to it. This simplification of complexity has done innumerable damage to our economies, societies, communities, morals and ethics that plays out in the black &amp;amp; white binaries of the media. We&amp;#39;ve lost any sense or appreciation of the complex. Instead of embracing it we sort to control it, to simplify it and establish it as ours. Big Data offers just that promise - but as with every attempt before it, economic, political, religious - will fail because it doesn&amp;#39;t fit. Instead it ends up contradicting itself. As Ian Bogost noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about correlation vs causation is: statistical correlation is becoming causation. Transparency won&amp;#39;t help. #tyrannyofalgorithms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Dear Student</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post from Jesse Stommel is extraordinarily good on a number of fronts that relate to my work and my way of thinking &amp;amp; being. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a link back to a previous post about what the &amp;quot;casualisation&amp;quot; of a workforce does to the workplace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are oppressed by a system that calls 75% of its labor-force ‘unnecessary,’ ‘contingent,’ ‘adjunct.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty harrowing stuff there, but it&amp;#39;s true. The economic rationalism that most universities and governments are now run by extolls these exonomic virtues at the expence of the humanity it should represent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads nicely into a quote from the &lt;em&gt;Obedience to Authority&lt;/em&gt; by Stanley Milgram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each individual possesses a conscience which to a greater or lesser degree serves to restrain the unimpeded flow of impulses destructive to others. But when he merges his person into an organizational structure, a new creature replaces autonomous man, unhindered by the limitations of individual morality, freed of humane inhibition, mindful only of the sanctions of authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic system has become the authority that allows us to throw away our humanity. It&amp;#39;s the justification for denying people good working conditions rather than operating within our actual means. I put this back to one of my contentious ideas: that the human default is to construct systems based on hierarchy and it is this that leads us into unthinking and uncaring obedience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can begin to have real discussions about these kinds of systemic problems then we are in effect throwing off the burden of the hierarcy. That to fix systemic problems it requires the relinquish of control, to hand over autonomy and begin to empower the individual. As Jesse suggests later in the post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built an almost ironclad academic system — and I acknowledge myself as one of its privileged builders — a system which excludes the voices of students, which calls students ‘customers’ while monetizing their intellectual property, which denigrates the work of learning through assessment mechanisms and credentialing pyramid schemes.” This is not a system that empowers students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the concept in the last paragraph particularly interesting: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be what Paulo Freire calls “teacher-students.” Specifically, he writes, “no one teaches another, nor is anyone self-taught.” So, “teacher” becomes a role that shifts, and learning depends upon a community of teacher-students. Any authority within the space must be aimed at fostering agency in all the members of the community. And this depends on a recognition of the power dynamics and hierarchies that this kind of learning environment must actively and continuously work against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wonder what that kind of an education system might look like and can&amp;#39;t help but think - like nothing we have today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>End the Gun Epidemic in America</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This opinion piece was on the front page of the New York Times. I don&amp;#39;t understand the gun culture of America, to me it&amp;#39;s as dissonant and illogical as fundamentalist religions. But this, this quote cuts through all the bullshit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency. These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting weapons of war into a civilian population will result in death, that&amp;#39;s what they were designed to do. This is not about protection, safety or independence, this is willing death in to your own community.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Shit Knife</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This story comes from a wonderful talk from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daviswade.com&quot;&gt;Wade Davis&lt;/a&gt; that formed the second half of this podcast from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/when-factories-close_-ancient-wisdom/6810052&quot;&gt;Big Ideas&lt;/a&gt;. The ideas presented as ancient wisdom confirm a lot of my beliefs about the nature of culture but one part of the lecture really stood out to me – the &amp;quot;shit knife&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inuit didn’t fear the cold; they took advantage of it. During the 1950s the Canadian government forced the Inuit into settlements. A family from Arctic Bay told me this fantastic story of their grandfather who refused to go. The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his tools and all of his implements, thinking that would force him into the settlement. But instead, he just slipped out of an igloo on a cold Arctic night, pulled down his caribou and sealskin trousers, and defecated into his hand. As the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of an implement. And when the blade started to take shape, he put a spray of saliva along the leading edge to sharpen it. That’s when what they call the “shit knife” took form. He used it to butcher a dog. Skinned the dog with it. Improvised a sled with the dog’s rib cage, and then, using the skin, he harnessed up an adjacent living dog. He put the shit knife in his belt and disappeared into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Shit Knife&amp;quot; is such a wonderful metaphor &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a video of that story (you can also watch the rest of the lecture if audio doesn&amp;#39;t do it for you). &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Web Annotations with Doug Schepers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After constant sync issues with Apple&amp;#39;s Podcast app I&amp;#39;ve jumped over to Marco Arments Overcast. It provides a nice alternative to iTunes for browsing and finding new podcasts and it&amp;#39;s how I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewebahead.net/&quot;&gt;The Web Ahead&lt;/a&gt;. I browsed the whole listing and cherry picked quite a few older episodes that struck my fancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 60: Web Annotations with Doug Schepers is a fantastic listen. Doug speaks with such passion about web annotations and highlights how it is the missing link in the webs current architecture. Commenting could be replaced by a specific annotation service. And it&amp;#39;s this service structure that makes the topic interesting - particularly when thought of through a distributed and federated framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you were empowered to comment, highlight, note, link to, compare and discuss on any site via your own infrastructure, your own service. That instead of feeding your comments into someone else&amp;#39;s system (and their business model) that you were able to share and syndicate that information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is it the actual annotations that are interesting, but the threads possible to create through the web. Linking sites, pages, sections and quotes from across the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all fits my &lt;a href=&quot;https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/the-quiet-page-linking-the-web/&quot;&gt;layered page metaphor&lt;/a&gt; and making this a web standard would allow this to not only possible, but ubiquitous. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Egyptian Lingerie and the Robot Future</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is what scares me about all the predictions of AI, Automation and post-labour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panic over automation misses the real problem — that workers themselves are treated like machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Frase articulates something more incidious than losing jobs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I fear most is not that all of our labor will be replaced with machines. Rather, like Yglesias, I worry that it won’t be — but for a slightly different reason. Again, bosses prefer workers to machines when they are cheaper and easier to control. Hence the truly dystopian prospect is that the worker herself is treated as if she were a machine, rather than being replaced by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the future that frightens me. Not the rise of the machines, but the supplication of the people. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Healing Brain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An extremely interesting and thought provoking interview with Norman Doidge, author of &lt;em&gt;The Brain&amp;#39;s Way Of Healing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Brain That Changes Itself&lt;/em&gt;. The concept of neural plasticity is changes the way we need to conceptualise not just the brain, but biology as a whole. Its the first real demonstration that I&amp;#39;ve seen where complex systems are actually integrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend this podcast (and by proxy the book) to anyone interested or connected to anyone dealing with neuralogical issues - strokes through to autism. It provides a reasoned argument for rethinking the way we tread these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I got out of this talk was two important concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the secret to the brain is understanding that it is an energy system. That it responds, controls, manipulates and translates energy in order for us to function. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer&quot;&gt;transducer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; - a device that converts one form of energy to another form of energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transducer concept is particularly important in many of the treatments that Doidge describes. By delivery energy in one from - visual, auditory, sensory - it can be converted into other energy forms. These can then &amp;quot;treat&amp;quot; the various conditions of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an introduction this is a great listen - Doidge is engaging and enthusiastic and capable of weaving a great narrative. For me it&amp;#39;s also kick started some thinking around energy and this concept of the transducer, a totally new term to me, but one that I can relate a lot of things too. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I Gave Up Alternating Current</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked this post up from &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and have to say that I feel the same as John Gruber - I can’t tell whether this is parody or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this as I am actually interesting in the concept of ditching Alternating for Direct Current. A return to localised power production via solar and wind would make sense for the more efficient DC standard and reduce the astounding amount of power wasted in transimission and conversion from AC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that bit was interesting. The rest is an insight into a very alternate (maybe alien) lifestyle. Some of it makes sense, but often choices seem to contradict each other and the logic seems convoluted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting adn intriguing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. - the author of the post was the inventor of the food replacement - Soylent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
