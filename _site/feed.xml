        <title>We’re all data now</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This podcast is a discussion on Big Data from a legal perspective. There&amp;#39;s some really interesting points here - in particular about the legal lens we operate under. The US focusses on National Security, the EU through Privacy but it would be interesting to see it persued as Property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I really got out of this was an interesting way of understanding why Big Data has become such a popular and messianic figure in our culture. As Annelise Riles states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I noticed was that after the 2008 crisis, regulators started to lose confidence in their own understanding of how the market worked. And at the same time, because they had been trained in that neoliberal era they also didn&amp;#39;t have confidence in government planning because the whole neoliberal idea was governments don&amp;#39;t know how to plan. So imagine what it&amp;#39;s like to be a regulator in that situation. You simply have no idea how to control this market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d relate this observation back to complexity. Complex systems don&amp;#39;t allow you to control anything in the same way that a hierarchical, simple or even complicated system would. Big data is becoming the way in which people are being fooled into thinking that control has been regained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that that idea that big data can save us from the failures of our expertise is not unique to finance. And in fact just for ordinary people, perhaps when we lose our confidence in how to choose a university or which flavour of ice cream to buy or how to choose a sexual partner, we suddenly turn to big data as a way of getting us out of our loss of expertise. So I see this turn to big data as a symptom of our sense that perhaps we&amp;#39;ve lost our foundations in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades (not just since 2008) expertise and insight have been slowly eroded by economic ideals. That everything can be simplified into a cell in a spreadsheet and a number attached to it. This simplification of complexity has done innumerable damage to our economies, societies, communities, morals and ethics that plays out in the black &amp;amp; white binaries of the media. We&amp;#39;ve lost any sense or appreciation of the complex. Instead of embracing it we sort to control it, to simplify it and establish it as ours. Big Data offers just that promise - but as with every attempt before it, economic, political, religious - will fail because it doesn&amp;#39;t fit. Instead it ends up contradicting itself. As Ian Bogost noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about correlation vs causation is: statistical correlation is becoming causation. Transparency won&amp;#39;t help. #tyrannyofalgorithms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Dear Student</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post from Jesse Stommel is extraordinarily good on a number of fronts that relate to my work and my way of thinking &amp;amp; being. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a link back to a previous post about what the &amp;quot;casualisation&amp;quot; of a workforce does to the workplace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are oppressed by a system that calls 75% of its labor-force ‘unnecessary,’ ‘contingent,’ ‘adjunct.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty harrowing stuff there, but it&amp;#39;s true. The economic rationalism that most universities and governments are now run by extolls these exonomic virtues at the expence of the humanity it should represent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads nicely into a quote from the &lt;em&gt;Obedience to Authority&lt;/em&gt; by Stanley Milgram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each individual possesses a conscience which to a greater or lesser degree serves to restrain the unimpeded flow of impulses destructive to others. But when he merges his person into an organizational structure, a new creature replaces autonomous man, unhindered by the limitations of individual morality, freed of humane inhibition, mindful only of the sanctions of authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic system has become the authority that allows us to throw away our humanity. It&amp;#39;s the justification for denying people good working conditions rather than operating within our actual means. I put this back to one of my contentious ideas: that the human default is to construct systems based on hierarchy and it is this that leads us into unthinking and uncaring obedience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can begin to have real discussions about these kinds of systemic problems then we are in effect throwing off the burden of the hierarcy. That to fix systemic problems it requires the relinquish of control, to hand over autonomy and begin to empower the individual. As Jesse suggests later in the post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built an almost ironclad academic system — and I acknowledge myself as one of its privileged builders — a system which excludes the voices of students, which calls students ‘customers’ while monetizing their intellectual property, which denigrates the work of learning through assessment mechanisms and credentialing pyramid schemes.” This is not a system that empowers students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the concept in the last paragraph particularly interesting: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be what Paulo Freire calls “teacher-students.” Specifically, he writes, “no one teaches another, nor is anyone self-taught.” So, “teacher” becomes a role that shifts, and learning depends upon a community of teacher-students. Any authority within the space must be aimed at fostering agency in all the members of the community. And this depends on a recognition of the power dynamics and hierarchies that this kind of learning environment must actively and continuously work against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wonder what that kind of an education system might look like and can&amp;#39;t help but think - like nothing we have today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>End the Gun Epidemic in America</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This opinion piece was on the front page of the New York Times. I don&amp;#39;t understand the gun culture of America, to me it&amp;#39;s as dissonant and illogical as fundamentalist religions. But this, this quote cuts through all the bullshit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency. These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting weapons of war into a civilian population will result in death, that&amp;#39;s what they were designed to do. This is not about protection, safety or independence, this is willing death in to your own community.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Shit Knife</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This story comes from a wonderful talk from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daviswade.com&quot;&gt;Wade Davis&lt;/a&gt; that formed the second half of this podcast from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/when-factories-close_-ancient-wisdom/6810052&quot;&gt;Big Ideas&lt;/a&gt;. The ideas presented as ancient wisdom confirm a lot of my beliefs about the nature of culture but one part of the lecture really stood out to me – the &amp;quot;shit knife&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inuit didn’t fear the cold; they took advantage of it. During the 1950s the Canadian government forced the Inuit into settlements. A family from Arctic Bay told me this fantastic story of their grandfather who refused to go. The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his tools and all of his implements, thinking that would force him into the settlement. But instead, he just slipped out of an igloo on a cold Arctic night, pulled down his caribou and sealskin trousers, and defecated into his hand. As the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of an implement. And when the blade started to take shape, he put a spray of saliva along the leading edge to sharpen it. That’s when what they call the “shit knife” took form. He used it to butcher a dog. Skinned the dog with it. Improvised a sled with the dog’s rib cage, and then, using the skin, he harnessed up an adjacent living dog. He put the shit knife in his belt and disappeared into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Shit Knife&amp;quot; is such a wonderful metaphor &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a video of that story (you can also watch the rest of the lecture if audio doesn&amp;#39;t do it for you). &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Web Annotations with Doug Schepers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After constant sync issues with Apple&amp;#39;s Podcast app I&amp;#39;ve jumped over to Marco Arments Overcast. It provides a nice alternative to iTunes for browsing and finding new podcasts and it&amp;#39;s how I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewebahead.net/&quot;&gt;The Web Ahead&lt;/a&gt;. I browsed the whole listing and cherry picked quite a few older episodes that struck my fancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 60: Web Annotations with Doug Schepers is a fantastic listen. Doug speaks with such passion about web annotations and highlights how it is the missing link in the webs current architecture. Commenting could be replaced by a specific annotation service. And it&amp;#39;s this service structure that makes the topic interesting - particularly when thought of through a distributed and federated framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you were empowered to comment, highlight, note, link to, compare and discuss on any site via your own infrastructure, your own service. That instead of feeding your comments into someone else&amp;#39;s system (and their business model) that you were able to share and syndicate that information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is it the actual annotations that are interesting, but the threads possible to create through the web. Linking sites, pages, sections and quotes from across the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all fits my &lt;a href=&quot;https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/the-quiet-page-linking-the-web/&quot;&gt;layered page metaphor&lt;/a&gt; and making this a web standard would allow this to not only possible, but ubiquitous. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Egyptian Lingerie and the Robot Future</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is what scares me about all the predictions of AI, Automation and post-labour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panic over automation misses the real problem — that workers themselves are treated like machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Frase articulates something more incidious than losing jobs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I fear most is not that all of our labor will be replaced with machines. Rather, like Yglesias, I worry that it won’t be — but for a slightly different reason. Again, bosses prefer workers to machines when they are cheaper and easier to control. Hence the truly dystopian prospect is that the worker herself is treated as if she were a machine, rather than being replaced by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the future that frightens me. Not the rise of the machines, but the supplication of the people. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Healing Brain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An extremely interesting and thought provoking interview with Norman Doidge, author of &lt;em&gt;The Brain&amp;#39;s Way Of Healing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Brain That Changes Itself&lt;/em&gt;. The concept of neural plasticity is changes the way we need to conceptualise not just the brain, but biology as a whole. Its the first real demonstration that I&amp;#39;ve seen where complex systems are actually integrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend this podcast (and by proxy the book) to anyone interested or connected to anyone dealing with neuralogical issues - strokes through to autism. It provides a reasoned argument for rethinking the way we tread these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I got out of this talk was two important concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the secret to the brain is understanding that it is an energy system. That it responds, controls, manipulates and translates energy in order for us to function. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer&quot;&gt;transducer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; - a device that converts one form of energy to another form of energy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transducer concept is particularly important in many of the treatments that Doidge describes. By delivery energy in one from - visual, auditory, sensory - it can be converted into other energy forms. These can then &amp;quot;treat&amp;quot; the various conditions of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an introduction this is a great listen - Doidge is engaging and enthusiastic and capable of weaving a great narrative. For me it&amp;#39;s also kick started some thinking around energy and this concept of the transducer, a totally new term to me, but one that I can relate a lot of things too. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I Gave Up Alternating Current</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked this post up from &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and have to say that I feel the same as John Gruber - I can’t tell whether this is parody or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this as I am actually interesting in the concept of ditching Alternating for Direct Current. A return to localised power production via solar and wind would make sense for the more efficient DC standard and reduce the astounding amount of power wasted in transimission and conversion from AC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that bit was interesting. The rest is an insight into a very alternate (maybe alien) lifestyle. Some of it makes sense, but often choices seem to contradict each other and the logic seems convoluted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting adn intriguing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. - the author of the post was the inventor of the food replacement - Soylent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Denominator Problem: Understanding the Rising Cost of Human Attention</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is just 24 hours long. Tomorrow will be 24 hours long, too. We sleep an average of 7.7 hours a night, which leaves 16.3 hours in which we humans can pay attention to, well, everything. That’s not increasing. So, in other words — no matter how much we think we can multitask, human attention is finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this take on time, attention and how it all relates to the information overload endemic in society. Rather than focus on people having to develop skills and practices in order to filter content, maybe we could actually start looking at the over production. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an observation I&amp;#39;d add that advertising is becoming increasingly meaningless. It noise that&amp;#39;s forcing different business models to emerge that no longer depend on ads to support them. Think Netflix. Think Spotify. Perhaps the next big thing coming, which I&amp;#39;ll be curious to see how plays out, is the fact that iOS 9 has native support to TURN OFF website ads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we actually break down the fixed time in the day it forces us to rethink what it is we are trying to achieve in that space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep: 7.5 hours (I’ll round down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School/Work: 8 hours (Let’s say the kids do very little, if any homework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other: 2 hours (Socializing, drinking, video games, playing sports, texting, showering, brushing your teeth, talking to family…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is 17.5 hours a day taken up by, well, living and stuff. So if every other waking second was spent consuming long and short form video — which it isn’t — that would only be 6.5 hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other idea in this piece that I can really relate to is a definition of time as a finite asset. One that we can and should measure &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; , rather than something to measure &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;. I have a huge issue with time as a measurement of anything - because it&amp;#39;s relative and far more complex. Seat time, labour hours - they&amp;#39;re proxies that are becoming more and more redundant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;#39;s time to re-think time. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blackboard’s Complexity Problems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Interesting take on the latest news from Blackboard. The comments perhaps are the best bit of the article - and where the most cogent points are made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty telling point  that resonates with my experience with most large scale technology projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackboard has chosen its strategy with Ultra. But by putting it off for so long there is now a lot of major work to be done instead of a steady stream of less risky changes/improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than ongoing and iterative updates, improvements and pruning you end up with something colossal that takes a massive amount of effort to change. Despite the rise of agile in development circles, it&amp;#39;s yet to make its way into the &amp;quot;Business As Usual&amp;quot; teams. And management? Fuhgeddaboudit.&lt;/p&gt;
