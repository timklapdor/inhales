So I feel like I'm on a roll with this new set of tools and am expanding my workflow.  In the last half hour I've managed to mobilise posting to GitHub and updating this site from my iPhone or iPad. I've also edited my first Python script and created my first gist. 

A vital part of my workflow is  mobile - pretty much every app or service I use needs to work on a mobile. Over the last couple of years I've really come to depend on mobile to get my work done because it's so versatile, flexible and damn convenient. I don't want a shitty version of the app - I look for an equivalent experience. 

I'd downloaded the iOS app Editorial a while ago which adds an interesting scripting layer to a fairly decent markdown editor but never really had a use for it. Knowing that the scripting but would be important for this new workflow I fired it up and tried a couple of the Jekyll add ons but nothing worked out of the box. 

I then found this on [updating your Jekyll site from your mobile](http://carlhicks.me/posts/2014-09-11-updating-mobile-jekyll-script.html) from Carl Hicks which included links to [Malphas Wats script](https://gist.github.com/MalphasWats/7977513), plus a few suggested edits. Changing the login information made sense and creating an API token was easy to do (follow the link from my Gist). 

I fired up [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) on my Mac, made some edits and then saved the Python file to Dropbox. Getting the my edited script on to my phone was a challenge as copy paste changed the indents and broke the script. Instead I'm Dropbox choose *Open With* and choose Editorial. Copy from there and Bob's your uncle! The last post - and probably this one - written and posted from my phone!

And as a bonus - [here's the Gist](https://gist.github.com/timklapdor/d692b2aa17b23681678f) I created with the amended code + some comments on where to change info so you can do it too!!
