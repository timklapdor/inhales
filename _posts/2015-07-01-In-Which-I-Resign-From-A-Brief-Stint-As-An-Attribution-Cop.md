Love this post from Alan Levine (@cogdog)! I think it would be great to see a concept like "manners" being embedded in online systems and interactions. In my blog post introducing [the concept of *MYOS*](https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/make-your-own-slogan-myos/) I discussed the concept of the "handshake" as an alternative to the binary Accept/Decline paradigm. I guess in way it was embedding a "please" into the process and humanising a common online interaction.
