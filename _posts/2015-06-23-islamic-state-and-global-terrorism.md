This is one of the most lucid accounts of how we got to the current situation in the Middle East. One of the surprising things in that the shows interviewee, David Kilcullen, is a former Australian army colonel who worked as a counterterrorist adviser to the US post 9/11.  If you're interested in unpacking how we got to where we are in the middle east I'd really suggest having a listen. 

As an aside, I found this article in The Atlantic, [What ISIS Really Wants](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/), made me feel infinitely more informed about ISIS the organisation. Combined with Kilcullen's assessment that we need to treat ISIS as a state and you get a much better understanding of the mechanations at work.
