Audrey Watters unpacks a recent research paper by the University of Maryland’s Melissa Kearney and Wellesley College’s Phillip Levine on the educational benefits of Sesame Street. This is a powerful piece that cuts through a lot of the issues facing educational reseach and the "publish or perish" mentality that is institutionally enshrined. Not only is the research not new and not really conclusive in particular key areas, it's the way that it's being promoted that is disturbing.

One of the key things Audrey adds to her critique is a history of Sesame Street from a research perspective and some expands on some of the assumptions made in the paper. 

The one about costs was particularly relevant:

>Incidentally, the study provides no dollar figures for the cost of developing either MOOCs or Sesame Street. For what it’s worth, the production costs of the former run anywhere from $150,000 to $300,000 per course; the latter costs about $615,000 per episode. "Cheap."

The other key assumption was the lack of research in and around Sesame Street:

>Indeed, **Sesame Street is the most researched television show in history** – and not just researched after-the-fact to ascertain how it’s affected students’ literacy and numeracy skills, but researched throughout the design and development process. 

Sesame Street is awesome. We know that. Anyone who grew up with it knows how impactful it has been on our lives, from counting to 12 to learning to read with a two-headed monster vocalising the sounds in your head. And the reason for this is because of the hard work and effort of those involved in creating and developing a program grounded in research. This wasn't an experiment outside the research, it was informed, guided and ultimately successful because it built on what was already there. 

Which MOOCs didn't.
