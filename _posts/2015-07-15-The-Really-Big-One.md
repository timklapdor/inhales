This is a hell of a compelling read. The article discusses the discovery and consequences of a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone. A massive tectonic fault line that runs down the length of the Pacific Northwest in North America. It's a place I've always wanted to visit but am now a little bit hesitant given the prediction it would be the site of the worst natural disaster in the history of the continent.

Perhaps what's interesting is the gap between knowing this and actually doing something about it. 

>That problem is not specific to earthquakes, of course. The Cascadia situation, a calamity in its own right, is also a parable for this age of ecological reckoning, and the questions it raises are ones that we all now face. How should a society respond to a looming crisis of uncertain timing but of catastrophic proportions? How can it begin to right itself when its entire infrastructure and culture developed in a way that leaves it profoundly vulnerable to natural disaster?

I guess this is what living in the Anthropocene is like.
