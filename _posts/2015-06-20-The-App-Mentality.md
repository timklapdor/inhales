An interesting post. I do however have an issue with this kind of statement:

>digital media has created a world in which “there should be and are immediate answers to all our questions. It’s sort of like an algorithmic way of thinking … I input this and I get this out. It’s going to be a very clear and immediate answer.”

Really? Digital Media created this? I can buy the concept outlined in the post but I think that our culture has created the mentality, not the technology. We seem to be focussed on the simple rather than complexity. It is our culture that puts “the emphasis is on the immediate, the definitive” not the technology we use. The kinds of traits they ascribe to youth sounds much more like symptoms of our broader society:

- If I do this, then I’ll get this outcome
- systematically move from step to step, with very few opportunities to take detours on unexpected paths
-  if the required app cannot be created, then the desire or question doesn’t or shouldn’t matter
- little time for sitting with ambiguity or complexity
- lack of time spent in quiet reflection
- there’s less time for the default mode of the brain to be active and to develop that self-understanding and empathy
