I lost my Dad 15 years ago and just the thought of losing a parent is still an emotional pressure point. There was a deep pang when Audrey  shared her loss, but this tweet really tore me up:

>Every time I start to feel bad for myself about losing my dad, I remember that my kid did this when he was 12
>https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/618244867513147392

That's about the same as my little sister and my brother was a bit older when it happened to us, and I can't imagine how hard that would be o be so young. 

I really wish I had the maturity to pen something like this. Something that captured the deep love but also frustrations of knowing a flawed man. Death is frequently used to paint a rosy picture, which oten conflicts with the emotions of those grieving - especially those closest.
