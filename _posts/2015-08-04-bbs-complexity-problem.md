Interesting take on the latest news from Blackboard. The comments perhaps are the best bit of the article - and where the most cogent points are made. 

This is a pretty telling point  that resonates with my experience with most large scale technology projects:

>Blackboard has chosen its strategy with Ultra. But by putting it off for so long there is now a lot of major work to be done instead of a steady stream of less risky changes/improvements. 

Rather than ongoing and iterative updates, improvements and pruning you end up with something colossal that takes a massive amount of effort to change. Despite the rise of agile in development circles, it's yet to make its way into the "Business As Usual" teams. And management? Fuhgeddaboudit.
