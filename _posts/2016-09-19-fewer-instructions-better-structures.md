title: "Fewer instructions, better structures"

---

I stumbled across this post from Ewan McIntosh and found that it echoed quite a lot of my recent thoughts on designing for learning. I'm a huge proponent of the idea of creating an "engaging experience, first and foremost", but all to often in education the focus is on curriculum-filling exercises and content. Maybe because it's the easy way out, maybe it's what we're used to. Maybe we're just too stuck on the [banking model of education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_education).

The goals Ewan provides are summarised here:

1. Encourage people to design experiences, not lessons.
2. Encourage people to speak less. 
3. Producers and educators could experiment with concentrating first and foremost on quality of engagement and experience.
4. Producers and educators should invest more their time empathising, observing and asking young people what makes them tick
5. There is a difference between instruction and structure. 

I'm really interested in the idea of exploring structure at the moment - something I hope I can do more of in the future. I think there are new possibilities if we look at transforming the structures of education rather than focussing on the content.
