My brother works in Canberra at the Parliament House library and works with politicians in all shapes and forms. His proximity to government gives him a unque insight into the mechanations of how it all works. I on the other hand am an arm chair political commentator. At Christmas time a ritual has begun to emerge where we consume a few bottles of wine and then attempt a reasoned argument around current political affairs. Needless to say it has often descended into a heated battle where there are pitched sides unwilling to back down (despite deep down we probably agree with each other). 

One of my recent themes in these arguments is the need to return to more democratic forms
of governance. The rise of the **Lawyer Class** that now dominates the political sector has, in my mind, driven a wedge between *The People* and *The Government*. In these arguments I've stated my preference to this current crop of politicians would be a randomly selected group of Australians being nominated, rather than elected, to serve in much the same way as jury duty. Why? Because those being elected to represent us simply don't. They don't share the experience of being a 'typical' Australian. They've never had to deal with the effects of reform because they live outside it. They never had to pay for university, go on the dole, earn minimum wage, work casually,  be breached their 'mutual obligations', or lose money on dodgy investments. No, the system works for them, it always has. They are a breed apart yet these are **our**(?) representatives! Really? 

OK, so [this podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/big-ideas-full-program-podcast/id164330831?mt=2&i=344319168) really speaks to me and my opinion that people, random people at that, can do a better job at this than politicians. Yes, it needs to be done in a facilitated and mediated way, but it works. And it works on the most complex issues, the stuff politicians can't and won't tackle. The stuff that's actually important - you know the environment, racism, sexism, equality, refugees. Could citizens juries replace governments? Maybe not, but they might be the only way we can actually get anything done in this place.
