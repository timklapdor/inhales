As part of my GitHub Pages and Jekyll journey I wanted to test the waters of hosting a standard static site. I was curious if you could do this lew of having to have access to standard webhosting solutions and also reduce costs by just purchasing a domain name. 

In doing that I wanted to quickly build a HTML site. To be honest it's been a while since I've done that, but I decided it was time to blow away the cobwebs and just do it. I actually loved hand coding HTML back in the day as it's the quickest way to avoid bloat and stuff you really don't need. Out whole university site was just static HTML pages back in the day and while it didn't have all the bells and whistles it was a charm to work with in comparison to our curren content management. With this background I know that getting something bespoke up quickly can be hard - tweaking something is often a lot quicker. In steps [boilerplates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_(text)) and [bootstraps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping). 

I've played a little with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) before but to be honest there's a learning curve there that I didn't care for. I can handle myself around HTML but bootstrap seemed to abstract a lot of what should be quite simple and easy to do. 

In my search I for an alternative I found [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com). It's simple, sleek and really well put together. Responsive out of the box without a myriad of extra css files it just so simple to get into without much fuss. So much so that it took about 15 minutes to get from download to single page site built. It's rough and needs some spit and polish but in those 15 minutes I worked out the structure, tweaked the CSS, replaced fonts, structured DIVs and had it hosted on GitHub Pages.

Simple and fast. What more could you want?
