Really poignant post on the ideology that's  driving Silicon Valley. Great read but summed up in this quote:

>The root of the problem is this: the notion of humans as Consumers ignores that as whole beings we have emotional, spiritual, and relational needs that are just as if not more important than the material. It ignores that these are met through useful, meaningful work, through contact with nature, through contact with each other. It ignores that without these things, we cease to be human.
