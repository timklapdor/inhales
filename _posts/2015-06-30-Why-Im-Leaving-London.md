An interesting article from Cory Doctrow on why he's moving from London to Los Angeles. He points to what seems to be a worldwide trend: that cities are becoming increasingly unliveable.  It might have something to do with the neo-liberal ideology that puts individuals (and their profit) before any social good or benefit. 

The "low tax" agenda that drives neo-liberalism is starving communities and local governments of their income and so to offset this loss they are selling off the commons. The public assets, services and infrastructure  that makes a place liveable, desirable even, are sold off in order to meet the deficit that's been created. 

Cities are shifting from centres of culture and social interaction to simply centres of gross consumption.
