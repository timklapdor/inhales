title: Don't Blame Uber

--- 

I've enjoyed Ben Thomsons *Stratechery* blog for sometime and I find his commentary measured and insightful. He has a way of catching key ideas and underlying tensions that others often miss. 

This post didn't start well for me. Uber is not a company that I'm overly fond of. I find many of their practices abhorrent and exploitative. Reading further I was starting to understand a bit more about what the tension is that creates those feelings. 

Let's draw a line and at one end we place Consumers and at the other Social. Then let's attempt to plot a variety of services and who actually benefits. 

I'd suggest that older companies tend to be more socially beneficial than new ones. When you look past price point the services they offer often have greater social impact (think taxes that pay for more community services). Newer models like Uber are almost all one sidedly consumerist. The consumer wins but at the expense of any tangible social benefit. 

Let's now do the same exercise and put the Business at one end and keep Social at the other. Now who benefits? Again it's heavily weighted towards the business. What Uber and the current raft of companies marketing them selves as "social and sharing" are actually engaged in is personalising the profits while socialising the cost. 

Their "social and sharing" functions are more aligned with exploitation, of passing on the costs without passing on the profit or broader benefits. 

If Silicon Valley did put its weight behind the pursuit of social benefit instead of profit then perhaps Uber would be a likeable company. Instead they put their money towards "disruption" - destroying the taxi industry rather than helping reform it, fighting against disability rights rather than helping those in need, and forcing down real wages instead of seeking to reform labour laws, health care or insurance. 

But hey, what more could you expect from Silicon Valley - a place built on short term wins and profiteering.
