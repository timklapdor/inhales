title: End the Gun Epidemic in America
---

This opinion piece was on the front page of the New York Times. I don't understand the gun culture of America, to me it's as dissonant and illogical as fundamentalist religions. But this, this quote cuts through all the bullshit:

> It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency. These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection. 

Putting weapons of war into a civilian population will result in death, that's what they were designed to do. This is not about protection, safety or independence, this is willing death in to your own community.
