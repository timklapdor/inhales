This post from Jonathan Rees is a response to Kate's and is a defence of the lecture:

>Say what you want about lectures, but your lecture is unequivocally yours. You went to graduate school. You learned your discipline. You keep up on your reading so that you know whatâ€™s fresh. You convey that information to your students. They (hopefully) learn something of what you know. 

I don't necessarily agree with all of Jonathon's points but I would say that this defence of lectures is very much shaped by a "content-first" approach to education. This is the historical model of the university - as storehouse and generator of knowledge and information. It has shaped teaching practices in higher education but it is being challenged and disrupted by technology. 

I can understand the desire to fight obsolescence, but I think that energy would be better served by attempting to change the model. To shift the model from "content-first" to an "activity-first" model. One that values *teaching* and *interaction* over content. Shifting the source of value is difficult - but I think its the best way to truly fight obsolence.
