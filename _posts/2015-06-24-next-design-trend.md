So they're calling Anticipatory Design the next big trend. 

>The next big breakthrough in design and technology will be the creation of products, services, and experiences that eliminate the needless choices from our lives and make ones on our behalf, freeing us up for the ones we really care about: Anticipatory design.

It's an interesting concept - one that fills me with horror and dread. It's an attempt to free us from “decision fatigue” which to me very much like "white-mans burden". The example they give:

>the tedium of calling a taxi after a late meeting to get to a concert, for example. 

Seriously? That's the kind of decision that you're worried about? You should be able to navigate that one on auto-pilot, because there isn't even a decision to be made! 

Don't get me wrong, I think there is an issue with the vast amount of choice and decisions that need to be made, but this has more to do with the consumer economy that places the highest value on **choice**, rather than *impact*. That's why there are 44 types of toothpaste, 20 types of peanut butter, a million pieces of plastic in every colour under the sun all which will will end up as landfill. 

The solution proposed is not to get rid of the pointless and inconsequential choices the system creates for us, but instead pretend to make choices for us by removing any sense of control we might have had.
